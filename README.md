# LearnJS

A collection of simple JavaScript practice programs to learn and revise core concepts like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic problem solving.

## About the repository

This repository contains multiple standalone `.js` files (`program1.js`, `program2.js`, ..., `program14.js`), each focusing on a small JavaScript concept or exercise. You can open any file, read the code, and run it directly with Node.js or in a browser console.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saurabhgv/LearnJS.git
   cd LearnJS
   ```

2. Run any program with Node.js:
   ```bash
   node program1.js
   ```

3. Alternatively, copy the code into your browser DevTools console and run it there.

## Repository structure

- `program1.js` – Introductory JavaScript program (e.g., basic syntax, variables).
- `program2.js` – More practice (e.g., conditionals or loops).
- `program3.js` – Additional exercises.
- `...`
- `program14.js` – Latest practice program.

You can rename files or add comments inside each file to describe what the specific exercise does.

## How to use this repo

- Read the code in each file to understand the logic.
- Modify the programs to try different inputs and scenarios.
- Add new files like `program15.js`, `arrays.js`, `functions.js`, etc., as you learn new topics.
- Use Git commits to track your learning progress over time.

## Future improvements

Planned enhancements (you can update this list as you work):

- Add comments and descriptions at the top of each file.
- Group programs by topic (basics, loops, functions, arrays, objects).
- Add a table in this README mapping each file to the concept it covers.
- Include sample input/output in comments for each program.
